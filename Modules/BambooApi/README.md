# Summary

This module allows for interacting with the Bamboo HR REST API.

Please note that this module has limited functionality and does not implement all API functionality by design.

# Authentication

Before you can use any other cmdlets, you need to run the ```Connect-BambooApi``` cmdlet to authenticate to your instance.

Once you are connected you can run other cmdlets.

# Examples
