# Summary

This module allows for interacting with the Zendesk API (e.g. creating/listing/updating tickets) via native PowerShell cmdlets.

# Usage

Before you can use any other cmdlets, you need to run the 'Connect-PowerZen' cmdlet to authenticate to your instance.

Once authenticated, you can run cmdlets such as:

- Get-ZenTicket
- New-ZenTicketNote
