# Introduction 
This repo contains PowerShell scripts and code snippets. The code is largely used as my personal toolbox, but you're welcome to use the tools if they're helpful to you.

# Getting Started
High level table of contents:
* Modules - this folder contains PowerShell modules such as GraphMailMessage. See the readme files for more details.
