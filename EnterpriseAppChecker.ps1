This script gets any Enterprise Applications whose SAML signing cert is expiring within a given window.
The cert is stored as the keyCredential property in the service principal.
The keyCredentials property is used to configure an applicationâ€™s authentication credentials.

Default SAML signing cert lifetime is 3y
